# Roadmap - SPEAK

## Project Mission & Summary
#### Locally and nationally, there is a need to connect science and the general public. Scientists are an underutilized resource for that connection. More opportunities for engagement in science are necessary for the well-being of our future. 
#### Less than 20% of Americans know a living scientist. Science serves all Americans and the public should have direct, meaningful access to science. 
#### We present SPEAK - Science Public Engagement AsKs. SPEAK will bridge the gap in how science is communicated to the public and how scienctist engage with the public.

## Aims of SPEAK:
* Organize opportunities for the public to learn about domain specific areas of science
* Strengthen communication between scientists and the public
* Acknowledgement and knowledge of living scientists by the public
* Improved science literacy across generations
* Personification of science
* Humanization of scientists
* Measure science engagement and outreach

## Timeline

### STAGE I : Build Momentum Through the March for Science Portland
#### SPEAK is a product of Portland Science Advocates, the organizers of the March for Science Portland. The March for Science is a global movement to put science at the forefront of decision-making processes and to provide a venue to communicate science to the communities it serves. Our local and global communities have rallied around this cause increasingly over the last 15 weeks. Momentum is a necessary input for any desired product. We will harsness the energy of the March for Science Portland and apply it to SPEAK.
